# Message Broker

This project is a **Go-based message broker** designed to efficiently handle message passing, processing, and communication across distributed systems. It provides a robust and scalable infrastructure to enable seamless data flow and integration.

## Project Summary

The **Message Broker** project is structured to achieve high performance and modularity. Below is a quick overview of its components:

### Project Structure

- **`load_test/`**: Contains scripts and configurations for performance and load testing to ensure the broker handles high traffic scenarios.
- **`deploy/`**: Includes deployment configurations, such as containerization or orchestration files.
- **`internal/`**: Holds internal components that are crucial to the broker's operations but are not exposed as public APIs.
- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts to automate tasks like building, testing, or running the project.
- **`api/`**: Contains API definitions and implementations to interact with the broker, likely including REST or gRPC.
- **`pkg/`**: Reusable packages that provide helper functions, shared utilities, or core logic for the application.
- **`main.go`**: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the broker and its components.

## Functionality Details

### Core Features

1. **Message Publishing**: Enables clients to publish messages to specific topics or channels.
2. **Message Consumption**: Supports subscription to topics, allowing clients to consume messages in real-time or via polling.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes messages among consumers to maintain efficiency and prevent overload.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures messages are not lost during failures by incorporating reliable delivery mechanisms.
5. **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing workloads through distributed processing and efficient resource utilization.

### Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The application starts from `main.go`, where the core broker services are initialized.
2. **Client Interaction**: APIs defined in the `api/` folder allow clients to interact with the broker for publishing and consuming messages.
3. **Message Handling**: The core logic in `internal/` processes messages, ensuring they are routed and delivered correctly.
4. **Deployment**: The `deploy/` folder includes tools for containerizing the broker or deploying it to environments like Kubernetes.
